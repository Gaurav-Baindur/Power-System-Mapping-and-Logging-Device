# Power-System-Mapping-and-Logging-Device
Device to help Power System Engineers to log and map Basic Power System information. 
This device can store coordinats of the electrical elements as well as basic electrical information and ratings of said elements in local storage. Once information is stored, in the required format, it can be sent wirelessly, either to a cloud or by mail, to an engineer for quick modelling and simulaiton of the Power System. This is device that is targetted at Power Systems Engineers to help them quickly collect and send data for furthur processing and analysing. This is an issue that has plagued the comapny that I work in, especially for large porjects like SRPC project.

Data Collected : Coordinates of the Electrical element like Transformers, Loads and so on. Type of the elements, Voltage and Current ratings and so on.

Hardware Used : ATmega328PU or ATmega16A, Keypad, SD Card Reader + Micro SD Card, IMU MPU9050, OLED Display.

Software Used : Arduino IDE/ATmel Studio 7 (Embedded C)
